		<br> I am a sophomore at Western Washington University, and i plan on majoring in Computer Science. This is my 3rd class that i've taken at western that deals with making websites. I also have alot of experience with web design from high school. I first learned html and css as i was designing our schools robotics team's website. Our team ended up going to World Championships that year. It was very exciting. Another huge excitement for me during my senior year was becoming a cheerleader! It was way out of my comfort zone but I enjoyed it a lot.<br><br> <img src="images/cheer.jpg" alt="Cheer Photo" title="My Cheer Team" style="width:700px;height:450px"; </img>
