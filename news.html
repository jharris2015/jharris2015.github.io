		<p id ="section"> Today the weather is a whopping 70 degrees. It's Memorial Day, so there are no classes, and no work for a lot of people. As I type this I am listening to beautiful country ballads, making me smile. I love this country, and I am so thankful for the Men and Women fighting for us. Hopefully everyone is hugging their loved ones today and remembering why we have the freedom that we do! Some headlines in the news today were scattered from Tiger Woods arrested with a DUI, to John McCain making a statement that "Vladimir Putin is a greater threat to national security than ISIS." Check in again tomorrow!<br><br><br><img src="images/MemorialDay.jpg" alt="Memorial Day" title="Memorial Day" style="width:300px;height:250px;">	</p>
